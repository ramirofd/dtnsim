This useCase is intended to run scenarios where two kind of faults injection are present:
random injection: removing random contacts
centrality injection: removing the more important contacts

In each scenario different contact plans are used.
The density of contacts is from 10% to 100%.

In order to run all the scenarios and obtain the result plots
run the scriptMain.sh script.

In order to only obtain the results in sqlite format 
run the script.sh script.

In order to only obtain the plots (once the sqlite results are obtained)
run the script2.sh script. 

Final Results in pdf format will be saved in "results/results_centrality" and "results/results_random" folders
