The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
16(1 to 6), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(16: 35.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (1/1) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(16: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 2 calls to RUCoP, which took 11 seconds and 2 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 16: (to: 6, time: 35.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6:
