The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
17(1 to 5), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(17: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 1 (1/1) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(17: 6), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 2 calls to RUCoP, which took 7 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 17: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 3, time: 0.000000), 
Node 2: 
Bundle 17: (to: 4, time: 0.000000), 
Node 3: 
Bundle 17: (to: 4, time: 0.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 17: (to: 5, time: 0.000000), (to: 5, time: 0.000000), 
Node 5:
