The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 
24(1 to 6), 26(1 to 4), 29(1 to 3), 37(4 to 5), 
--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 
(26: 41.000000), (29: 0.000000), (37: 0.000000), 
--------------------
That means, that overall 0.75 (3/4) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 
(24: 7), (26: 2), (29: 1), (37: 1), 
--------------------
Overall, the computation required 11 calls to RUCoP, which took 83 seconds and 11 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Bundle 24: (to: 2, time: 0.000000), (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 26: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Bundle 29: (to: 3, time: 20.000000), 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Bundle 24: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Bundle 26: (to: 4, time: 60.000000), 
Node 4: 
Bundle 24: (to: 5, time: 80.000000), 
Bundle 37: (to: 5, time: 80.000000), 
Node 5: 
Bundle 24: (to: 6, time: 100.000000), (to: 7, time: 110.000000), 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Bundle 24: (to: 6, time: 125.000000), 
Node 8: 
Node 9:
